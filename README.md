# Simple-FICS-Interface

A simple web interface for Free Internet Chess Server (FICS) with a chess board.

Try it <a href="https://cday-with-ai.github.io/Simple-FICS-Interface/" target="_blank">here</a>.

- Chat currently works and you can observe games but it is still in progress.
- The drag and drop when moving pieces still needs work. I wouldn't suggest playing a game with it yet.
