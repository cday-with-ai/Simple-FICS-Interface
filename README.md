A minimalist FICS interface which focuses on easy game play and chat functionality. It should eventually work on mobile and tablet devices.

Currently, under construction. See the Road Map below for the current state.

Road Map:
- Fix auto scrolling.
- Fix bug where tells from channel tabs are not sent.
- Make speed promotion checkboxes.
- Add premove.
- More changes for Responsive web design that work on mobile and tablets.
  - Add a layout when width is an issue. Put clocks on top and bottom.

Not planned at this time:
- Bughouse/Crazyhouse support.
- Viewing multiple boards at once.
