Try it <a href="https://cday-with-ai.github.io/Simple-FICS-Interface/" target="_blank">here</a>.

A minimalist FICS interface which focuses for easy game play and chat functionality.

Currently, under construction. It is usable to observe games, but you might run into bugs while playing.

Road Map:
- Fix artifact when dragging a piece.
- Add a layout when width is an issue. Put clocks on top and bottom.
- Fix game end.
- Fix bug where tells from channel tabs are not sent.
- Add timeseal2.
- Responsive web design that works on mobile and tablets.

Won't be implemented:
- Bughouse/Crazyhouse support.
- Viewing multiple boards at once.
