# Responsive UI Design & Implementation Plan

## Overview

Implement responsive design with orientation-aware layouts, comprehensive theming system, and device size support for
the chess interface.

## Architecture Approach

### ðŸŽ¨ **Theming System**

- **CSS-in-JS** with Styled Components for dynamic theming
- **CSS Custom Properties** for theme tokens
- **Theme Provider** context for app-wide theme management
- **System preference detection** with user override capability

### ðŸ“± **Responsive Strategy**

- **CSS Grid/Flexbox** for layout structure
- **Container Queries** + Media Queries for breakpoints
- **Custom React hooks** for orientation/viewport detection
- **Component composition** for different layout modes

### ðŸ”„ **Layout Management**

- **Landscape Mode**: Horizontal layout with sidebar
- **Portrait Mode**: Vertical stack with collapsible panels
- **Dynamic switching** with smooth transitions
- **State persistence** across orientation changes
