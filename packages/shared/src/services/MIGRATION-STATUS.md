# Chess Engine Migration Status

## Completed âœ…
- Basic TypeScript structure for ChessBoard class
- Type definitions (enums, interfaces)
- Move class with full TypeScript types
- Basic board setup and FEN handling
- Move generation framework and types
- Piece movement patterns for all pieces

## In Progress ðŸš§
- Complete move validation logic
- Variant-specific rules implementation
- Check/checkmate/stalemate detection
- Game termination conditions
- Move execution with proper state updates

## Todo ðŸ“‹
1. **Core Engine Logic** (from original ChessBoard.js)
   - [ ] Move parsing (_parseFlexibleSan)
   - [ ] Move validation (_isLegalMove)
   - [ ] Move execution (_executeMove)
   - [ ] Check detection (_isCheck, _isCheckmate)
   - [ ] Game state evaluation

2. **Variant Support**
   - [ ] Losers variant rules
   - [ ] Suicide variant rules
   - [ ] Atomic variant rules
   - [ ] Crazyhouse variant (with drops)
   - [ ] Chess960 setup and castling
   - [ ] Freestyle variant

3. **Additional Features**
   - [ ] Move history navigation
   - [ ] Position repetition detection
   - [ ] 50-move rule
   - [ ] Insufficient material detection
   - [ ] Premove validation

4. **Integration**
   - [ ] Update GameStore to use new ChessBoard
   - [ ] Migrate utility functions
   - [ ] Create comprehensive tests

## Notes
- The original ChessBoard.js is ~2500 lines
- Focusing on core functionality first
- Variant-specific logic will be added incrementally
- TypeScript provides better type safety and IDE support
