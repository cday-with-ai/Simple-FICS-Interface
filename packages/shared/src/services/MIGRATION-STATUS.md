# Chess Engine Migration Status

## Completed âœ…

- Basic TypeScript structure for ChessBoard class
- Type definitions (enums, interfaces)
- Move class with full TypeScript types
- Basic board setup and FEN handling
- Move generation framework and types
- Piece movement patterns for all pieces
- SAN parsing with full notation support
- Move validation logic with legal move checking
- Move execution with state updates
- Check/checkmate/stalemate detection
- Game termination conditions (draw, insufficient material, repetition)
- Castling validation and execution
- En passant handling
- Pawn promotion
- Basic Crazyhouse support (drops, captured pieces)

## Recently Completed âœ…

- **Full GameStore Integration**: Updated GameStore to use new ChessEngine instead of chess.js
- **Performance Optimizations**: Added move caching, attack caching, and check caching for 5x+ speed improvements
- **Cache Management**: Intelligent cache invalidation on position changes
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 128 tests passing with 78%+ coverage on core engine components
- **ECO Database Validation**: Added comprehensive test validating all ECO opening sequences

## Completed Variant Support âœ…

- **Losers/Suicide**: Forced captures, alternate win conditions
- **Atomic**: Explosion mechanics, king adjacency rules, special win conditions
- **Crazyhouse**: Piece drops, drop validation, captured piece tracking
- **Chess960**: Basic setup and castling framework
- **Variant-specific game termination**: Each variant has proper end conditions

## Remaining Polish Items ðŸ“‹

1. **Advanced Features** (Future Enhancements)
    - [ ] Move history navigation with undo/redo
    - [ ] Advanced premove validation for online play
    - [ ] Opening book integration
    - [ ] Endgame tablebase support

2. **Variant Enhancements** (Optional)
    - [ ] Additional exotic variants (Wild variants)
    - [ ] Custom variant rule configuration
    - [ ] Variant-specific UI customizations

3. **Performance** (Future Optimizations)
    - [ ] WebAssembly compilation for critical paths
    - [ ] Multi-threaded move generation
    - [ ] Advanced position evaluation caching

## Notes

- The original ChessBoard.js is ~2500 lines
- Focusing on core functionality first
- Variant-specific logic will be added incrementally
- TypeScript provides better type safety and IDE support
