# ChessAPI Cleanup Status

The ChessAPI files have been successfully moved to the `chessapi` subdirectory:

## ✅ Completed:

- Created `/services/chessapi/` subdirectory
- Moved all ChessAPI*.ts files to `/services/chessapi/`
- Moved ChessAPI test files to `/services/chessapi/__tests__/`
- Updated imports in GameStore to use `../services/chessapi`
- Created index.ts for clean exports

## 🧹 Still needed:

- Remove duplicate ChessAPI*.ts files from `/services/` root
- Remove duplicate ChessAPI*.test.ts files from `/services/__tests__/`

## 📁 Final structure:

```
services/
├── chessapi/           # ✅ New home for ChessAPI
│   ├── ChessAPI.ts
│   ├── ChessAPI.*.ts
│   ├── __tests__/
│   └── index.ts
├── FicsProtocol.ts     # Other services remain
